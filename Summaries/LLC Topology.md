# Isolated DC-DC Converter utilizing GaN power device for Automotive Application / Matsumori

200V ---> 13.6V conversion (500W). Boost + LLC Converter is coupled.

**The LLC resonant converter can adjust output voltage by adjusting switching frequency, but the switching frequency variation makes the conversion efficiency low.**

ZVS is achieved in the boost converter and the LLC converter. LLC converter is operated in constant frequency with 272V.

LLC efficiency lowers if the switching frequency is not as close as possible to the resonance frequency. The first harmonic approximation is invalid, and the sinusoidal waveform is lost.

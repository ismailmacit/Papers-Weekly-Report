# High Step-down Two-stage DC/DC Converter for Low Voltage Battery Charger
 
 BUCK + LLC 
 
 LLC employs a constant switching frequency, while the Buck stage regulates output voltage
 
 DCM Buck controls the output using duty cycle, LLC is fixed.
 
 Buck stage is designed for DCM operation, leading to a significantincrease in current ripple and, consequently, higher turn-off loss and RMS current.
